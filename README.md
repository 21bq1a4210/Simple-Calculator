# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- User-friendly interface
- Responsive design
- Keyboard support

## How It Works

1. The calculator interface is designed using HTML and CSS, providing a user-friendly layout with buttons for numbers and operators.
2. JavaScript is used to add functionality to the calculator:
   - The `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions perform the corresponding arithmetic operations.
   - The `operate` function takes two numbers and an operator as input and uses the appropriate function based on the operator.
   - Event listeners are set up for button clicks to handle user input and update the display.
   - Keyboard events are also captured to enhance user experience.

## Usage

1. Open the [Simple Calculator Web Application](https://21bq1a4210.github.io/Simple-Calculator/) in a web browser.
2. Use the number buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to input an arithmetic expression.
3. Press the "Calculate" button (=) to see the result displayed.
4. Press the "Clear" button (C) to clear the input.
5. You can also use your keyboard to interact with the calculator:
   - Press Enter to calculate the expression.
   - Press Escape to clear the input.
   - Press number keys (0-9) and operator keys (+, -, *, /) to input the expression.
